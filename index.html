                            <p>The Usability Test project focused on evaluating the functionality of a digital kiosk through real user interactions. Leveraging a carefully crafted strategy, participants were recruited from diverse backgrounds to ensure comprehensive feedback reflective of the target demographic. Challenges in recruitment, including geographical constraints and time limitations, were overcome through an extensive outreach strategy utilizing social media, community forums, and local networks. Utilizing Word, a structured usability test was devised to present tasks systematically, maintaining consistency in testing conditions. Observations during the test provided invaluable insights into user behaviors, frustrations, and moments of ease, complemented by feedback gathered through surveys and interviews. The project not only enhanced proficiency in designing effective usability tests but also underscored the importance of nuanced observation techniques in understanding user experiences beyond quantitative data. Ultimately, the project aimed to refine the digital kiosk prototype based on user feedback, contributing to its overall performance and usability.

                            <p>Cosplay Exhibit mockup, I meticulously analyzed usability test data to refine the wireframe of a digital kiosk, aiming to replicate real-world aesthetics and functionality. Centered around a cosplay exhibition theme, the wireframe features a homepage introducing the exhibition and category pages showcasing the exhibition map, history, craftsmanship, and an interactive game. Challenges arose in interpreting user behavior and aligning the design with cultural expectations, prompting a multifaceted approach. Leveraging Adobe XD and Illustrator, I refined visual elements and enhanced user engagement based on feedback and observations. This process illuminated the symbiotic relationship between design, usability, and cultural context, emphasizing the importance of crafting designs that resonate with diverse audiences. Ultimately, the project not only enriched my skill set but also underscored the significance of cultural sensitivity in creating impactful interactive experiences.</p>

                                The Build-A-Bear rebrand project focused on revitalizing the company's identity, employing a range of strategies to achieve this goal. This endeavor involved the creation of a new logo, the production of a promotional video, the development of a social media advertisement, and the crafting of a mockup for the About page. Through the utilization of design tools such as Adobe XD, Premiere Pro, and Photoshop, the team ensured meticulous attention to detail in every aspect of the rebranding process. Leveraging Wix as the development platform, they aimed to seamlessly integrate the refreshed brand image into the online sphere, enhancing Build-A-Bear's digital presence. By adopting a comprehensive approach, the project sought to imbue the brand with a fresh, captivating aesthetic while maintaining consistency across diverse platforms, thereby strengthening its connection with existing and potential customers.</p>

                    <h3>I'm Kiara Castillo Magallanes</h3>
                    <h4>A <span>UI/UX designer </span>and <span>Front-end</span> based in Indy.</h4>
                    <p>I'm thrilled to introduce myself as a sophomore enrolled in the Media Arts and Science program at IUI, specializing in Web Design and Development. Throughout my academic journey, I've delved into an array of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, SCSS, and PHP. Alongside, I've refined my design acumen, mastering tools such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Figma, and Microsoft Publisher.

                       <br> My fervor lies in design thinking and UX/UI design. Continuously driven to broaden my expertise, I strive to elevate user experiences through intuitive design solutions. Currently seeking internships in web design and UX/UI, I am committed to translating my knowledge into practical application. I firmly advocate for the significance of hands-on experience in this industry and am poised to make a meaningful impact within any collaborative environment.
                        
                      <br>  As I actively pursue internships, I am eager to contribute and grow professionally. Recognizing the value of networking and mentorship, I am open to guidance that can steer me towards a prosperous career in the dynamic realm of design.</p>
